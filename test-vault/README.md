# Duskfrost Test Vault

A fully realized Obsidian lorebook vault for DeepLore Enhanced. **~257 entries** covering the city of Duskfrost — its factions, districts, species, history, and political intrigue — while simultaneously exercising every frontmatter field, gating mechanism, health-check condition, and graph topology the extension supports. Versioned with the extension source.

**Theme:** Duskfrost — a sprawling fantasy city built on the ruins of a pre-Calamity civilization. Gritty urban fantasy with political intrigue, faction conflict, underground economies, and magic that always has costs.

## World Overview

Duskfrost is a coastal city of ~80,000 residents, governed by three noble houses (the **Triumvirate**: Harcyne, Velkhast, Morveth) in a shifting balance of alliances. The **Duskfrost Academy** regulates arcane practice. The **Solarguard** patrols the wealthy districts while the **Bonehands** control the harbor and marsh. Magic is channeled through sigils and costs something every time.

The current year is **355 PC** (Post-Calamity). The city sits on the ruins of a civilization destroyed by cascading arcane failure ~355 years ago. A recently discovered fragment of the old resonance grid beneath Rappiop Grove has all three houses quietly maneuvering. The Velkhast succession crisis has paralyzed harbor trade. The Champions of Patience are declining. The Keepers of the Scar watch the wound in Highwallow and worry.

**Key districts** (top to bottom of the bluff): Bellsummit (wealth/Academy), Amberburgh (merchants), Scorchhelm (military), Bayside Shushail (harbor/crime), Highwallow (marsh/poverty). Plus: Rimeborough (cold/northern), Redpond (lake/fishing), Saseopt/East Hamp/South Sool (residential).

**15 custom species** with distinct cultures, districts, and politics — from bioluminescent Zuvine salvagers to subterranean Gnaino echolocators to cold-resistant Delivese metalworkers.

## Manual QA Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Era Gating
1. `/dle-set-era medieval`
2. Send: "Tell me about the war"
3. **Expect:** `events/war-of-the-broken-mountain.md`, `lore/war-of-glimmering-hope.md`, `lore/battle-of-the-false-prophet.md` eligible
4. **Expect NOT:** `events/war-of-kroyhr.md` (era: ancient), `events/battle-of-the-vanguard-crossing.md` (era: reconstruction)

### Scenario 2: Location Gating
1. `/dle-set-location Bellsummit`
2. Send: "I walk through Gorduin's office"
3. **Expect:** `characters/gorduin-wynlar.md` AND `locations/bellsummit.md` inject (both match location)
4. **Expect NOT:** `lore/oracles-summit.md` (requires character_present Ayre Waesphyra)

### Scenario 3: Cascade Links
1. Send: "The Angel Crown sits in the vault"
2. **Expect:** `items/angel-crown.md` matches AND `lore/war-of-glimmering-hope.md` auto-injects via cascade
3. **Expect:** On next generation mentioning Angel Crown — no injection (cooldown:2)

### Scenario 4: Requires Chain (3-deep)
1. Send: "Adelas is cataloguing today"
2. **Expect:** `characters/adelas-gilydark.md` does NOT inject (requires Gorduin, who is not matched)
3. Send: "Gorduin and Adelas are cataloguing"
4. **Expect:** Both inject (Gorduin matched, so Adelas's require is satisfied; Gorduin requires Oracles of Might which must be in vault)

### Scenario 5: Mutual Excludes
1. Send: "The Bonehands collect tribute on the docks"
2. **Expect:** `organizations/bonehands.md` injects; `organizations/solarguard.md` does NOT inject
3. Send: "The Solarguard patrols Scorchhelm"
4. **Expect:** `organizations/solarguard.md` injects; `organizations/bonehands.md` does NOT inject

### Scenario 6: Warmup (3 occurrences required)
1. Send: "Snugug is at the docks" — **Expect:** no injection (count 1)
2. Send: "Snugug blocks the entrance" — **Expect:** no injection (count 2)
3. Send: "Snugug steps forward" — **Expect:** injection (count 3, warmup satisfied)

### Scenario 7: Cooldown (skip 1 generation)
1. Send: "Grolgrurim negotiates" — **Expect:** `characters/grolgrurim-bluntgut.md` injects (warmup:1 satisfied)
2. Send: "Grolgrurim continues the meeting" — **Expect:** no injection (cooldown:1 — skip 1 generation)
3. Send: "Grolgrurim stands up" — **Expect:** injects again (cooldown expired)

### Scenario 8: All-4-Fields Gating (strict blocks)
1. Clear all context: `/dle-set-era`, `/dle-set-location`, etc. (no active context)
2. Set tolerance to `strict` in settings
3. Send: "The solstice ceremony begins" (matches `lore/solstice-ritual.md` keywords)
4. **Expect:** No injection — `solstice-ritual.md` requires all 4 gating fields; none are set; strict mode blocks

### Scenario 9: All-4-Fields Gating (lenient allows)
1. Same setup as Scenario 8, but set tolerance to `lenient`
2. Send: "The solstice ceremony begins"
3. **Expect:** Injection — lenient mode allows entries even when their gating context is not fully set

### Scenario 10: character_present (multi-character AND)
1. Set character_present to only Gorduin Wynlar (not Ayre)
2. Send: "Felicitas arrives at the meeting"
3. **Expect:** `characters/felicitas-langguth.md` does NOT inject (requires BOTH Gorduin AND Ayre present)
4. Set character_present to include both Gorduin Wynlar and Ayre Waesphyra
5. Send: "Felicitas arrives at the meeting"
6. **Expect:** Injection

### Scenario 11: Health Check Validation
1. Connect this vault in a test vault config
2. Run `/dle-rebuild`
3. Run `/dle-health`
4. **Verify:** 7+ errors including circular requires, self-exclude, duplicate titles, orphaned requires, requires+excludes contradiction
5. **Verify:** 9+ warnings including empty content, probability zero, cooldown-on-constant, oversized entries, short keywords
6. **Verify:** 1 info: unresolved wiki-link

### Scenario 12: Graph Topology
1. Run `/dle-graph`
2. **Verify:** Gorduin Wynlar is a hub node with many connections
3. **Verify:** Assault of Broken Love and Battle of Vryhs appear as an isolated pair
4. **Verify:** Oracles of Might cluster is visible (gorduin, ayre, bellsummit, oracles-tower, etc.)
5. **Verify:** Bonehands and Solarguard show excludes edges (if rendered)

### Scenario 13: refine_keys Gate
1. Send: "Ayre is working today"
2. **Expect:** `characters/ayre-waesphyra.md` does NOT inject (keyword "Ayre" matches, but refine_keys [ancient, elder, pre-Calamity] not present in text)
3. Send: "Ayre is studying ancient texts"
4. **Expect:** Injection (both primary key AND refine_key satisfied)

### Scenario 14: AI-Only Entry (scanDepth: 0)
1. Enable AI search, set to two-stage mode
2. Send: "There's a secret agreement between the houses"
3. **Expect:** `lore/hidden-compact.md` appears in AI results (AI can find it semantically)
4. **Verify:** It does NOT appear in keyword-only mode (scanDepth: 0 means no keyword scanning)

### Scenario 15: Injection Position Verification
1. Send any message that matches `locations/east-hamp.md` keywords ("East Hamp")
2. **Verify:** Injected BEFORE the chat (position: before)
3. Match `locations/saseopt-district.md` ("Saseopt")

## How to Use This Vault

### For RP Testing
1. Point DLE at this vault directory
2. Run `/dle-rebuild` — should index ~230 entries (minus disabled/never-insert)
3. Set era to `medieval` or `renaissance`, set a location, and start chatting
4. The vault is a coherent world — entries cross-reference naturally and the AI should produce consistent RP

### For QA Testing
1. Run through the Manual QA Test Scenarios above
2. Run `/dle-health` — verify errors/warnings match the expected list
3. Run `/dle-graph` — verify topology (hub nodes, clusters, isolated pairs, excludes edges)
4. The `_edge-cases/` directory covers parser edge cases and health check conditions

### Health Check Baseline
The expected errors and warnings above serve as the baseline. Any deviation (extra warnings, missing errors) indicates a health check regression.

### Future Automated Tests
Integration tests can read vault files directly, call `buildIndex()`, and assert matching behavior against known inputs without requiring a running Obsidian instance. The deterministic content makes assertions stable.
