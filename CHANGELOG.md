# Changelog

## 0.8-ALPHA

### New Features
- **Context Cartographer** -- Adds a book icon button to each AI message's action bar. Click it to see which vault entries were injected, why they matched, their priority, and token cost. Configurable Obsidian vault name enables clickable deep links that open entries directly in Obsidian.
- **Session Scribe** -- Automatically summarizes roleplay sessions and writes them to your Obsidian vault as timestamped markdown notes with frontmatter. Triggers after every N AI messages (configurable). Also available on demand via `/dle-scribe`, with optional focus topics.
- **`/dle-scribe` slash command** -- Write a session summary on demand. Optionally provide a focus topic, e.g. `/dle-scribe What happened with the sword?`
- **Obsidian write support** -- New server plugin route (`POST /write-note`) enables writing markdown notes back to the vault.

### Settings
- New "Obsidian Vault Name" field in Connection settings for deep links.
- New "Show Lore Sources Button" toggle in Injection settings.
- New "Session Scribe" settings section: enable toggle, auto-scribe interval, session folder, custom summary prompt.

### Internal
- Lore source data persisted in `message.extra.deeplore_sources` for per-message tracking across sessions.
- Bumped version to 0.8-ALPHA.

## 0.7-ALPHA

### Improvements
- **Accurate token counting** -- Uses SillyTavern's built-in tokenizer instead of the rough `length / 3.5` estimate. Token budgets and stats are now much more accurate. Falls back to estimation if the tokenizer is unavailable.
- **Better recursive scanning** -- Recursive matching now only scans content from newly matched entries each step, avoiding redundant work and preventing wasted cycles when entries reference each other.
- **Sentence-aware manifest truncation** -- AI search manifest summaries now cut at sentence boundaries instead of mid-word, giving the AI better context for entry selection.
- **Runtime settings validation** -- All numeric settings (including AI search settings) are clamped to valid ranges on load and save. Invalid values are corrected automatically.
- **Added package.json** -- Provides version tracking and repository metadata.
- **Added unit tests** -- Test coverage for frontmatter parsing, content cleaning, title extraction, keyword matching, sentence truncation, hash function, and settings validation. Run with `node tests.js`.

### Internal
- Bumped version to 0.7-ALPHA.
