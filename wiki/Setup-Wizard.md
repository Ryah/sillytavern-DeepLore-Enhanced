# Setup wizard

The setup wizard walks you through configuring DeepLore for the first time. Nine pages: vault connection, tags, matching, AI search, the Librarian, vault structure, and lorebook import. Goes from install to working lore injection without leaving the popup.

## When it runs

- **Automatically** on first load when the extension has never been configured
- **Manually** any time with `/dle-setup`

You can re-run the wizard whenever you want to reconfigure. It prefills with your current settings.

## Pages

### 1. Welcome

Introduction to what the wizard configures. No settings on this page.

### 2. Obsidian connection

Connect to your Obsidian vault's Local REST API plugin.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Vault Name | `Primary` | Display name for this vault |
| Host | `127.0.0.1` | IP or hostname where Obsidian is running |
| Port | `27123` | REST API port (set in the Local REST API plugin settings) |
| Use HTTPS | Off | Switch to HTTPS (default port 27124). HTTP is recommended |
| API Key | empty | Bearer token from the Local REST API plugin settings |

Click **Test Connection** to verify. The test must pass before you continue.

> [!NOTE]
> HTTP is recommended. HTTPS requires installing the plugin's self-signed certificate to your OS trust store, and DLE does not bundle a setup walkthrough for that. If you need HTTPS, see the [Local REST API author's guide on trusting the certificate](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-web/wiki/How-do-I-get-my-browser-trust-my-Obsidian-Local-REST-API-certificate%3F).

**Demo vault:** A collapsible callout at the bottom introduces the bundled Duskfrost demo vault (257 pre-built entries). Click "Show me how" for instructions on opening the bundled `test-vault` folder as an Obsidian vault, then "Auto-fill connection for demo vault" to populate the connection fields.

> If the test fails, check that Obsidian is open and the Local REST API plugin is enabled. See [[Troubleshooting#Connection Issues]].

### 3. Tags and search mode

Configure which Obsidian tags identify lorebook entries, and pick your search strategy.

**Tags:**

| Tag | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Lorebook tag | `lorebook` | Entries with this tag are indexed |
| Constant tag | `lorebook-always` | Always injected regardless of matching |
| Seed tag | `lorebook-seed` | Sent to AI search as story context on new chats |
| Bootstrap tag | `lorebook-bootstrap` | Force-injected when chat is short |

**Search mode** (radio buttons):

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Keywords only | Match entries by keyword triggers only. No AI calls |
| Two-stage | Keywords pre-filter, then AI search ranks the candidates. Recommended |
| AI only | Send the entire vault manifest to AI search. More thorough, more expensive |

If you select keywords-only, the AI search and Librarian pages are skipped. (Both depend on a tool-calling AI connection.)

### 4. Matching configuration

Configure how deep the keyword scanner looks and how many entries can inject.

**Vault size presets:**

| Preset | Scan Depth | Max Entries | Token Budget |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Small | 4 | 10 | 2,048 |
| Medium | 6 | 15 | 3,072 |
| Large | 8 | 20 | 4,096 |

Click a preset to fill the values, or set them manually:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Scan Depth | Recent messages to scan for keywords (0 to 100) |
| Max Entries | Maximum entries to inject per generation |
| Token Budget | Maximum total tokens for injected lore |
| Unlimited Entries | Ignore the max entries cap |
| Unlimited Budget | Ignore the token budget cap |
| Fuzzy Search | Add BM25 ranked-relevance scoring alongside keyword matching |

### 5. AI search setup

*Skipped if you chose keywords-only on page 3.*

Choose how DLE connects to an AI for entry selection.

- **Profile mode:** use a saved SillyTavern Connection Manager profile. Pick from the dropdown
- **Custom Proxy mode:** point at a custom proxy (e.g., `claude-code-proxy`). Enter the proxy URL and model name

Click **Test AI Connection** to verify the selected connection works.

> [!WARNING]
> Custom Proxy mode requires `enableCorsProxy: true` in `SillyTavern/config.yaml`. Without it, proxy calls throw a descriptive error.

### 6. Librarian

*Skipped if you chose keywords-only on page 3.*

Configure the Librarian. Optional. Gives the writing AI two tools during generation: `search` (look up vault entries the pipeline missed) and `flag` (record a missing-lore gap for you to review later). Flagged gaps appear in the drawer's Librarian tab, where Emma helps you author new entries from them.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Enable Librarian | Off | Master toggle for the Librarian feature |
| Search tool | On (when Librarian is on) | Writing AI can look up vault entries the pipeline missed |
| Flag tool | On (when Librarian is on) | Writing AI can flag gaps in your lore for later review |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tool definitions add ~300 to 500 tokens to every generation's system prompt. Each `search` call adds a round-trip to the generation; `flag` calls don't. Start with just the flag tool if you want to minimize cost and see what your AI reaches for before enabling search.

The Librarian requires a tool-calling provider (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI-compat, Cohere). Enabling it auto-enables function calling on the active connection. If you disable function calling elsewhere on that profile, tool invocations break mid-generation.

### 7. Vault structure

Optional. Creates starter files in your Obsidian vault.

| Item | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Field definitions | `DeepLore/field-definitions.yaml` | Custom gating field schema. See [[Custom Fields]] |
| Sessions folder | `Sessions/` | Where Session Scribe writes notes |

Both are checkboxes. Status indicators show success or error for each.

### 8. Import

Optional. Import an existing SillyTavern lorebook into your Obsidian vault. You can also import later with `/dle-import`.

Import methods:

- **Skip import** (default): set up entries in Obsidian manually or import later
- **From SillyTavern lorebook:** select an existing ST World Info book from a dropdown
- **From JSON file:** upload a World Info export JSON or V2 character card
- **From paste:** paste raw JSON text directly

Set a target folder for imported entries. Results show counts of imported, failed, and renamed entries.

### 9. Done

Review what got configured:

- Vault connection details
- Search mode
- Matching settings (entries, budget)
- Files created

Action buttons let you immediately:

- **Run Health Check:** audit your entries for issues
- **Open Graph:** open the relationship graph
- **Browse Entries:** open the entry browser
- **Open Settings:** fine-tune advanced settings
- **Meet Emma:** open Emma the Librarian to write your first style guide. Recommended next step

## What happens on finish

When you click **Finish**:

1. All settings are saved
2. The extension is enabled
3. A full vault index build is triggered
4. The wizard completion flag is set so the wizard does not auto-launch again

You're ready. Send a message and watch the drawer's Injection tab to see lore being selected.
